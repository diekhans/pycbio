This is Mark Diekhans's <markd@ucsc.edu> personal collection of Python 3
libraries and tools for computational biology related work.  it is especially
geared to working with data from the UCSC Browser.

This comes with a liberal BSD license. Use as you wish, however it comes with
the caveat that I make break compatibility at any time.  As a personal tool,
it has no formal release process.  If a project needs to link to a stable
version, I will gladly add a tag on request.

Additional, if you fork this package with the intent of redistributing it,
please rename the top-level package from `pycbio', to avoid import conflicts.
