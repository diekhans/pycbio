Issues with make that inspired this package:
    - composition with make is requires recursive make
    - recursive makes does play well with multiple thread
    - syntax difficult
    - make doesn't support multiple output files for a single execution of a
      rule
    - error handling in make is problematic (need pipefile; $(shell ...) does
      fail
      - error cleanup of produces files on failed rules is problematic
