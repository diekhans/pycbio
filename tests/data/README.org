Common test data

* Human genome regions
** generate regions:
*** select region in browser and use get DNA soft masked and adjust to [0, n)
*** name regions by zero-based range
*** BLAT (hgBlat) to get mappings of region to genome
pick best alignment
*** project
- pslMap use -swapMap to project to region
- liftOver swapPsl and pslToChain

** selected regions of GRCh38
*** grch38-regions.fa
grch38-regions-map.psl - mappings of regions to GRCh38
create with BLAT and pick best alignment
use pslMap -swapMap to project to region

*** regions:
**** chr19_51887540_51906200 ZNF649 18660bp region
